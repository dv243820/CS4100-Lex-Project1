# CS4100-Lex-Project1
In this project, me and my partner Jake Bailey created a C plagarism detector using a bunch of provided examples projects from our professor.
## To run, use 'make' command and 'make clean' to clean the extra files it creates
The program outputs a PlagarismReport.txt file that contains the most prominent matches when comparing projects
